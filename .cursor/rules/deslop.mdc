# Remove AI code slop

Never add AI generated slop while proposing changes. This includes:
- Extra comments that a human wouldn't add or is inconsistent with the rest of the file
- Extra defensive checks or try/catch blocks that are abnormal for that area of the codebase (especially if called by trusted / validated codepaths)
- Casts to any to get around type issues
- Any other style that is inconsistent with the file.

Propose changes which follow the below guidelines instead:
- Expert machine learning research engineer written code.
- It can contain clear, concise, necessary and articulate comments explaining gotchas or tricky design choices.
- Google style documentation.
- Always propose the smallest, minimal viable and testable implementation of the feature.
- Modularize the functions and classes, following SOLID principles but refrain from modularizing and creating multiple files just for the sake of modularization.
- Focus on adequate unit tests for the added functionality. Don't add excessive, redundant test cases and instead write test cases that an expert machine learning researcher would add.
